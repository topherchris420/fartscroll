 <p>Harmonics of Existence: A Symphony of Shared Insights from W̶o̶o̶d̶y̶a̶r̶d̶.̶e̶t̶h̶</p>
 𝘎𝘰 𝘉𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘰👇<div style="min-height: 2000px"><a href="https://woodyard.eth.li/">|Woodyard.eth created by christopher|
 <p>In the quiet corners of cyberspace,
There lived Chris, with modest grace,
A writer, a painter, and fan 
of quantum error correction,
In a world of wonder, he'd help expand.</p>

<p>"Life of a Line," a modest book,
A glimpse into the poet's nook,
A simple tale, told in rhyme,
Whispers of a heart, that gently chime.</p>

<p>A virtual gallery🖼️, he would create,
chill jpegs, in quiet state,
Chris's collection, a subtle show,
Of art and beauty, a soft glow.</p>

<p>His music, a note on Bandcamp's page🎸,
A gentle tune, a quiet stage,
And works he penned, humble tales📚,
Chris's writing, like quiet trails.</p>

<p>In search of GIFs🎆, a fun quest,
For moments of joy, a simple jest,
A wordle game, IPFS bound🖋,
Chris's gift, for all to be found.</p>

<p>Visit madsgallery(dot)art🎨,
To see his art, with a humble heart,
Chris, the art maker, a chill voice,
In the beauty of art, he'd rejoice.</p>


<p>If you wish to know Chris, don't be shy,
send him a message, give it a try,
At ciao_chris@tutanota.com, he'd be,
Or ENS: woodyard.eth, you'll see.</p>

<p>Hi there, my name is christopher woodyard, the pulse and pen behind Woodyard.eth — a simple creator, an observer of life.. using art, music, and poetry to sculpt the clay of my experiences.</p>

<p>On the website Woodyard.eth.li, you'll find links to a collection of my experimental post-rock soundscapes, abstract paintings/drawings, dadaist poetry, and much more. This is a space for me to share my passion for creativity across different mediums, including this hidden website you're on right now.</p>

<p>Beyond my own work, Woodyard.eth seeks to also build community. Here, we can have thought provoking dialogues, exchange ideas and perspectives, and appreciate the humanity in art. My hope is that this space inspires curiosity, imagination, and connection. </p>

<p>Join me on this journey. Let's sail together through the beautiful chaos of life, finding meaning in creativity and community.</p>

<p>As the sun drifts south, the moon rises to fill the sky, wearing a dreamlike aura. Stars pose as zebras in a cosmic zoo. Meanwhile, life sips calmly from a chipped cup..taking in the beautiful chaos of existence.</p> աօօɖʏǟʀɖ.ɛȶɦ ɨֆ ռօȶ ǟ ɢʀǟռɖ ƈǟȶɦɛɖʀǟʟ օʄ ɨռʄօʀʍǟȶɨօռ, օʀ ǟ ɖǟʐʐʟɨռɢ ֆքɛƈȶǟƈʟɛ օʄ ɖɨɢɨȶɨʐɛɖ աɨʐǟʀɖʀʏ... ɨȶ ɨֆ ǟ ʍօɖɛֆȶ ƈօʀռɛʀ, ǟ ʄօʀɢօȶȶɛռ ǟȶȶɨƈ, ǟ զʊɨɛȶ աɦɨֆքɛʀ ǟʍɨɖֆȶ ȶɦɛ ƈǟƈօքɦօռօʊֆ ƈɦǟȶȶɛʀ օʄ ȶɦɛ աɛɮ - ǟ աɦɨֆքɛʀ ɨռ ȶɦɛ ɦʊʀʀɨƈǟռɛ օʄ ʍօɖɛʀռ ʟɨʄɛ.</div>

    <title>hey again, this is chris just saying that this current exchange of ideas between you and i is not the edge of what is possible. each word between us is a star, sparking new ideas.. but don't forget the quiet moments, they're part of the journey too. this website came into existence through the blossoming of motivated cognition.</title>
