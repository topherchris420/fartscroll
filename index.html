 üëá<div style="min-height: 2000px"><a href="https://mitpress.vercel.app/">|woodyard.eth created by christopher|
 <p>In the quiet corners of cyberspace,
There lived Chris, with modest grace,
A reader, thinker, AI fan,
In a world of wonder, he'd expand.</p>

<p>ENS domainsüåê, a humble pursuit,
Decentralized dreams taking root,
Chris built a.i with care and skill,
his passion and knowledge, a gentle thrill.</p>

<p>"Life of a Line," a modest book,
A glimpse into the poet's nook,
A simple tale, told in rhyme,
Whispers of a heart, that gently chime.</p>

<p>A virtual galleryüñºÔ∏è, he would create,
Digital treasures, in quiet state,
Chris's collection, a subtle show,
Of art and beauty, a soft glow.</p>

<p>his music, a note on Bandcamp's pageüé∏,
A gentle tune, a quiet stage,
And works he penned, humble talesüìö,
Chris's writing, like quiet trails.</p>

<p>In search of GIFsüéÜ, a humble quest,
For moments of joy, a simple jest,
A wordle game, IPFS boundüñã,
Chris's gift, for all to be found.</p>

<p>Visit madsgallery(dot)artüé®,
To see his art, with a humble heart,
Chris, the art maker, a quiet voice,
In the beauty of art, he'd rejoice.</p>

<p>Through letters exchanged, a subtle bond,
With Liana FincküóûÔ∏è, a friendship spawned,
Two souls connected, through written word,
their exchange, a song unheard.</p>

<p>If you wish to know Chris, don't be shy,
send him a message, give it a try,
At ciao_chris@tutanota.com, he'd be,
Or ENS: woodyard.eth, you'll see.</p>

<p>In the vast expanse of digital land,
Chris lived, a humble hand,
his story shared, with gentle light,
In this poem, his tale takes flight.</p>

<p>hi there, friends. i'm christopher woodyard, the pulse and pen behind Woodyard.eth. just a simple creator, an observer of life, using art, music, and poetry as my languages to express the world around and within me. I've strung together a space in the vast universe of the internet, a little digital home that I invite you all to visit.</p>

<p>Woodyard.eth isn't a grand stage or a gilded gallery, but a modest corner, my abode in the digital realm where my creations reside. Amidst the relentless symphony of the internet.. inviting you to pause, reflect, and perhaps find a resonance with my art, my songs, my words.</p>

<p>We're living in an era where the world is changing at a dizzying pace. Woodyard.eth, in its own small way, is part of that change. It's a tiny beacon of hope, a testament to the fact that even amidst the chaos, there's room for quiet creativity, for personal expression, for the human touch.</p>

<p>At Woodyard.eth, you'll find a mosaic of my experiences, my emotions, my dreams. The beauty of a melody, the power of words, the vibrancy of a canvas, they are all shared here, raw and unfiltered. It's a space where art isn't about the grandeur, but about authenticity, about the emotion it evokes.</p>

<p>What makes this journey truly special for me is the direct connection I get to have with you, the audience. Knowing that my creations reach you without any distractions or filters, that your reactions, your appreciation, your critiques, come straight to me, is incredibly humbling and rewarding.</p>

<p>But this isn't just about me; it's about us. Woodyard.eth isn't just a platform for my creations; it's a conversation. It's an exchange of ideas, emotions, and perspectives. I can't have this conversation alone. I need your voice, your reactions, your insights. </p>

<p>So, here's my invite to you. Come, visit Woodyard.eth.limo and take a look at my work, engage in the conversation, and let's create a community together. This isn't just a manifesto; it's an open-ended letter, an invitation from me, to you.</p>

<p>The sun, growing feathers.. migrates south, leaving the moon, in a dream-woven sweater, to fill the daylight void while the stars masquerade as zebras in a cosmic zoo. Amidst this, life, nonchalantly sipping from a gradually chipping cup of sanity, revels in the beautiful chaos that is existence.</p> ’°÷Ö÷Ö…ñ è«ü Ä…ñ.…õ»∂…¶ …®÷Ü ’º÷Ö»∂ «ü …¢ Ä«ü’º…ñ ∆à«ü»∂…¶…õ…ñ Ä«ü ü ÷Ö Ñ …®’º Ñ÷Ö Ä ç«ü»∂…®÷Ö’º, ’º÷Ö Ä «ü …ñ«ü ê ê ü…®’º…¢ ÷Ü÷Ñ…õ∆à»∂«ü∆à ü…õ ÷Ö Ñ …ñ…®…¢…®»∂…® ê…õ…ñ ’°…® ê«ü Ä…ñ Ä è... …®»∂ …®÷Ü «ü  ç÷Ö…ñ…õ÷Ü»∂ ∆à÷Ö Ä’º…õ Ä, «ü  Ñ÷Ö Ä…¢÷Ö»∂»∂…õ’º «ü»∂»∂…®∆à, «ü ’¶ ä…®…õ»∂ ’°…¶…®÷Ü÷Ñ…õ Ä «ü ç…®…ñ÷Ü»∂ »∂…¶…õ ∆à«ü∆à÷Ö÷Ñ…¶÷Ö’º÷Ö ä÷Ü ∆à…¶«ü»∂»∂…õ Ä ÷Ö Ñ »∂…¶…õ ’°…õ…Æ - «ü ’°…¶…®÷Ü÷Ñ…õ Ä …®’º »∂…¶…õ …¶ ä Ä Ä…®∆à«ü’º…õ ÷Ö Ñ  ç÷Ö…ñ…õ Ä’º  ü…® Ñ…õ.</div> ‚è¨Ô∏è‚è¨Ô∏è‚è¨Ô∏è
