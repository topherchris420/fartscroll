 𝘎𝘰 𝘉𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘰👇<div style="min-height: 2000px"><a href="https://mitpress.vercel.app/">|Woodyard.eth created by christopher|
 <p>In the quiet corners of cyberspace,
There lived Chris, with modest grace,
A writer, a painter, and drAIke fan,
In a world of wonder, he'd expand.</p>

<p>"Life of a Line," a modest book,
A glimpse into the poet's nook,
A simple tale, told in rhyme,
Whispers of a heart, that gently chime.</p>

<p>A virtual gallery🖼️, he would create,
chill jpegs, in quiet state,
Chris's collection, a subtle show,
Of art and beauty, a soft glow.</p>

<p>his music, a note on Bandcamp's page🎸,
A gentle tune, a quiet stage,
And works he penned, humble tales📚,
Chris's writing, like quiet trails.</p>

<p>In search of GIFs🎆, a fun quest,
For moments of joy, a simple jest,
A wordle game, IPFS bound🖋,
Chris's gift, for all to be found.</p>

<p>Visit madsgallery(dot)art🎨,
To see his art, with a humble heart,
Chris, the art maker, a quiet voice,
In the beauty of art, he'd rejoice.</p>


<p>If you wish to know Chris, don't be shy,
send him a message, give it a try,
At ciao_chris@tutanota.com, he'd be,
Or ENS: woodyard.eth, you'll see.🎶</p>

<p>hi there, my name christopher woodyard, the pulse and pen behind Woodyard.eth — a simple creator, an observer of life.. using art, music, and poetry as my languages to express the world around and within me. I've strung together this space, a little digital home that I invite you all to visit.</p>

<p>Woodyard.eth is a place, a haven where my work finds solace. In the midst of the internet's relentless symphony, it offers a gentle invitation to pause, reflect, and perhaps resonate with my art, my melodies, and my words.</p>

<p>We're living in a time where the world is changing at a dizzying pace. Woodyard.eth, in its own small way, is part of that change. It's a tiny beacon of hope, a testament to the fact that even amidst the chaos, there's room for quiet creativity, for personal expression, for the human touch.</p>

<p>Woodyard.eth is a place where my experiences, emotions, and dreams are woven into a tapestry. Art in all its forms (music, literature, and visual art) is shared here in its raw, unfiltered form. It's a space where the authenticity of creative expression takes precedence over grandeur, celebrating the power of emotions it evokes.</p>

<p>Yet, this isn't merely about me; it's about you. Woodyard.eth isn't just a showcase for my creations; it's a dialogue, an exchange of thoughts, feelings, and views. I can't engage in this dialogue alone. I yearn for your voice, your reactions, your insights.. </p>

<p>So, I extend this invitation to you. Venture into Woodyard.eth.limo, see my work, participate in the conversation, and let's cultivate a community together. This isn't just a manifesto; it's an open-ended letter, a heartfelt invitation from me, to you.</p>

<p>The sun, growing feathers.. migrates south, leaving the moon, in a dream-woven sweater, to fill the daylight void while the stars masquerade as zebras in a cosmic zoo. Amidst this, life, nonchalantly sipping from a slightly chipped cup of sanity, and celebrates the beautiful chaos that is existence.</p> աօօɖʏǟʀɖ.ɛȶɦ ɨֆ ռօȶ ǟ ɢʀǟռɖ ƈǟȶɦɛɖʀǟʟ օʄ ɨռʄօʀʍǟȶɨօռ, օʀ ǟ ɖǟʐʐʟɨռɢ ֆքɛƈȶǟƈʟɛ օʄ ɖɨɢɨȶɨʐɛɖ աɨʐǟʀɖʀʏ... ɨȶ ɨֆ ǟ ʍօɖɛֆȶ ƈօʀռɛʀ, ǟ ʄօʀɢօȶȶɛռ ǟȶȶɨƈ, ǟ զʊɨɛȶ աɦɨֆքɛʀ ǟʍɨɖֆȶ ȶɦɛ ƈǟƈօքɦօռօʊֆ ƈɦǟȶȶɛʀ օʄ ȶɦɛ աɛɮ - ǟ աɦɨֆքɛʀ ɨռ ȶɦɛ ɦʊʀʀɨƈǟռɛ օʄ ʍօɖɛʀռ ʟɨʄɛ.</div> ⏬️⏬️⏬️
